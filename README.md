# LabVIEW Example: 9×9 Multiplication Table

This project uses the **9×9 multiplication table** as a simple example to demonstrate:

- **SubVI** — reusable subroutines (e.g., compute one row or one cell)
- **CSV write** — saving the table to a CSV file
- **CSV read** — loading the table from a CSV file

---

## Overview

| Feature   | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **SubVI** | Multiplication logic is implemented in SubVIs so the main VI stays clear and the same code can be reused (e.g., for a single cell or a full row). |
| **CSV save** | The full 9×9 table is written to a CSV file (e.g. `multiplication_table.csv`) with optional headers. |
| **CSV read** | The table is read back from the CSV file and can be displayed or used in the VI. |

## Project structure (conceptual)

```
├── Main.vi              # Top-level: build table, save/load CSV, display
├── SubVIs/
│   ├── Multiply_Cell.vi    # SubVI: multiply two numbers (one cell)
│   └── Build_Row.vi         # SubVI: build one row of the table (1×n to 9×n)
├── multiplication_table.csv # Example output (generated by the application)
└── README.md
```

## SubVI usage

- **Multiply_Cell.vi**  
  Inputs: two numbers (e.g. row index, column index).  
  Output: their product.  
  Used to compute each cell of the table.

- **Build_Row.vi**  
  Input: row number (1–9).  
  Output: array of 9 products (e.g. 1×1 … 1×9).  
  Used to build one row; the main VI loops over rows to build the full 9×9 table.

---

## CSV save

- Build the full 9×9 table (e.g. 2D array or array of rows).
- Optionally add a header row (e.g. column labels 1–9).
- Write to a CSV file using **Write Delimited Spreadsheet** or similar, with comma as delimiter.
- Output file example: `multiplication_table.csv`.

---

## CSV read

- Use **Read Delimited Spreadsheet** (or equivalent) to load the CSV.
- Parse the result into a 2D array (9×9).
- Display in a table or use the data in subsequent logic.

---

## Requirements

- LabVIEW (version as per your project; e.g. 2018 or later).
- No extra toolkits required for basic CSV read/write and SubVIs.

---

## How to run

1. Open the main VI.
2. Run the VI: it builds the 9×9 multiplication table (using the SubVIs), writes it to a CSV file, and can then read it back and show the result.
3. Check the generated `multiplication_table.csv` in the output directory.
